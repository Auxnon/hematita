Mid Tier Features
-----------------
These are features that aren't exactly simple, but aren't exactly hard.

- Function scope
- Virtual machine structure

Grand Features
--------------
These are hard to implement features that should be implemented later rather than sooner.

- Garbage collector
- String interning
